# ERC667: A Mixed ERC20/721/1155 Token Standard for Supply Chain Management

**Author:** Emiliano Solazzi, 2024

## Overview

ERC667 is a Solidity smart contract that implements a mixed token standard combining ERC20, ERC721, and ERC1155 functionalities.
It is specifically designed for supply chain management, enabling assets to transition between unique (ERC721) and fungible (ERC20/1155) states. 
This allows for comprehensive tracking, fractionalization, and lifecycle management of assets in supply chain processes.

## Features

- **Mixed Token Standard:** Combines ERC20, ERC721, and ERC1155 functionalities into a single contract.
- **Supply Chain Management:** Tracks assets across different phases, including unique and fungible states.
- **Custom Metadata:** Supports custom URIs for tokens, allowing detailed tracking of asset information.
- **Role-Based Access:** Uses OpenZeppelinâ€™s `Ownable` contract to manage administrative roles and permissions.
- **Batch Operations:** Supports batch minting, burning, and transferring of tokens.
